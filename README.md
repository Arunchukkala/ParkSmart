# ParkSmart
A full-stack web application similar to ParkMobile that allows users to locate, view, and book nearby parking spots in real time. The system helps users find available spaces in multiple regions, while administrators manage parking lots, pricing, and availability through a secure dashboard.

The app includes separate User and Admin roles, secure login/registration, booking management, and real-time spot updates.
